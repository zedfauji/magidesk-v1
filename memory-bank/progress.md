# Progress

## Project Status
-   **Forensic UI Audit**: [Complete] (F-0001 to F-0132 verified and synced to Linear).
-   **Backend Forensic Audit**: [In-Progress] (Analyzing backend invariants for each feature).
-   **Implementation (Phase 3)**: [Planned] (Pending Backend Audit results).

## Milestones
-   [x] Phase 1: Foundation & Core Transaction Flow
-   [x] Phase 2: Payment Expansion (Weeks 5-7)
-   [x] Forensic UI Audit (F-0001 - F-0132)
-   [ ] Backend Forensic Audit (Features F-0001 - F-0132)
-   [ ] Implementation Phase 3 (Gap Closure & Modernization)

## Current Focus
Conducting a feature-bound Backend Forensic Audit. For each UI feature (F-XXXX), we are documenting the required backend invariants, forbidden states, and concurrency rules.
