# First Run Checklist

Congratulations on installing Magidesk! Use this checklist to ensure your system is ready for service.

## ✅ 1. Hardware Check
- [ ] **Touchscreen**: Verify touch is accurate and responsive.
- [ ] **Receipt Printer**: Print a test page from Windows to confirm it works.
- [ ] **Cash Drawer**: Ensure it pops open when a receipt is printed (if connected to printer).

## ✅ 2. System Login
- [ ] **Log In**: Use the default Admin PIN: `1234`.
- [ ] **Change PIN**: Go to **Admin > Users** and change the default PIN immediately for security.

## ✅ 3. Menu Verification
- [ ] **Check Categories**: Ensure "Beer", "Food", "Wine" categories appear.
- [ ] **Test Item**: Add an item to a ticket and check the price.
- [ ] **Modifiers**: Verify that modifying an item (e.g., "No Onions") works correctly.

## ✅ 4. Test Transaction (Training Mode)
- [ ] Create a new order.
- [ ] Add items.
- [ ] "Pay" for the order using **Cash**.
- [ ] Verify the receipt prints correctly with your business name and address.
- [ ] Void the transaction afterward if needed.

## ✅ 5. Table Layout
- [ ] Go to the **Table Map**.
- [ ] Verify your tables are in the correct positions.
- [ ] If not, use the **Table Designer** (Admin > Tables) to arrange them to match your floor plan.
