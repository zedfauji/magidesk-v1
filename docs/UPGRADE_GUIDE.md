# Upgrade Guide

## Updating Magidesk

We regularly release updates with new features and fixes. Here is how to update securely.

### Before You Upgrade
1. **Close Magidesk** on ALL terminals.
2. **Perform a Backup** (optional but recommended): Ask your manager to back up the database configuration.

### Running the Update
1. Download the new installer (e.g., `Magidesk-v0.2.0-Setup.exe`).
2. Run the installer on the Main Server first.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions. It will replace the old files.
4. Launch Magidesk.
   - **Note:** The system may take a few minutes to start up the first time as it upgrades your database data automatically. **Do not interrupt this process.**

### Updating Terminals
1. Once the Main Server is updated and running, repeat the installation on all secondary terminals.
2. Launch them and log in.

> **Important:** All terminals must be on the same version number to ensure the system works correctly. Do not mix versions.
